# Whisper

A modern web application for creating and managing zones where users can share thoughts, media, and engage in discussions.

## Features

Whisper enables users to create and manage zones, where each zone has its own description and set of rules. Users can create drops with rich text formatting, and the platform supports uploading images and videos. Real-time toast notifications keep users informed of their actions and provide feedback within the application.

The application is responsive, working seamlessly on all devices, and supports both dark and light themes to cater to user preferences. Authentication is handled securely with NextAuth.js, and all data is managed in a PostgreSQL database using Prisma ORM.
