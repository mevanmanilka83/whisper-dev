## Overview

Whisper is a modern collaborative platform that reimagines how people connect, share, and collaborate online. At its core, Whisper is built around the concept of "zones" - dedicated spaces where communities can form around shared interests, ideas, or projects.

### The Whisper Experience

Whisper transforms online collaboration through zones - dedicated spaces where communities form around shared interests. Users create zones for any topic, from tech discussions to creative projects, each becoming a vibrant hub of activity. Within zones, users share "drops" - rich posts with text, images, and advanced formatting. Zone owners can invite collaborators, users can request to join, and real-time notifications keep everyone connected and engaged.

### Why Whisper?

Whisper combines the best of social media, content management, and collaboration tools into one seamless experience. Whether you're a creator looking to build an audience, a team working on a project, or someone who wants to connect with like-minded people, Whisper provides the tools and platform to make it happen.

Built with modern web technologies and designed for the future, Whisper offers a responsive, accessible, and beautiful experience across all devices.
