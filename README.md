## Overview

Whisper is a modern collaborative platform where users can create and manage zones to share thoughts, media, and engage in discussions. Think of it as a social platform organized around themed spaces called "zones" - each zone has its own community, content, and rules.

### What is Whisper?

**Zones**: Users can create zones (like subreddits or Discord channels) around any topic or interest. Each zone has a name, description, and can be customized by its owner.

**Drops**: Within zones, users create "drops" - posts that can contain rich text, images, and videos. Drops support advanced formatting and media uploads.

**Collaboration**: Zone owners can invite others to collaborate, and users can request to join zones. The platform includes a complete invitation and membership management system.

**Real-time Features**: Users get notifications for invitations, join requests, and other activities. The interface provides real-time feedback with toast notifications and live counters.

**Modern Tech Stack**: Built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and MongoDB. Features Google OAuth authentication, responsive design, and dark/light theme support.

Whisper combines the best aspects of social platforms, content management systems, and collaboration tools into a single, intuitive application.
